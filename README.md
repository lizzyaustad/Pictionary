# Pictionary 
## A website to help you play pictionary

The site comes preloaded with possible word options, but more words can also be added by clicking the "Add Word" button.
When all personal choice words have been added, "Start Game" should be clicked. This will randomize the word list, clear the scores, and provide an initial word or phrase for the first person to draw. Once that person has seen the word, they should start the timer by clicking "Start Timer," which will make the word disappear so others can also see the screen. This will start a countdown from 60 seconds; once the timer reaches 0, the word will be revealed. If the team was able to guess correctly, they should click the "+" button for their team box to add a point to their score.
